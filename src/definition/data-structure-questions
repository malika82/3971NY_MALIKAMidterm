Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A.
1-each Data Structure allows data to be stored in a specific manner.
2-Data structure allows efficient data search and retrieval.
3-Specific Data Structures are designed to work for specific problems;
4-it allows to manage large amount of data such as large databases and indexing services such as Hash table


What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
1-Insertion: adding new record to Data structure;
2-Deletion: Removing particular record from the data structure.
3-Searching: Finding the location of the record in data structure.
4-Sorting: Arranging records in a specific order.
5-Merging: Combining the records from different data structures to single data structure.
6-Traversing:Accessing and processing records .

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
1-Compiler Design.
2-Operating System.
3-Database Management System
4-Statistical analysis package
5-Numerical Analysis.
6-Graphics.
7-Artificial Intelligence

what is an Array?
An array id a Data Structure containing a number of a same data type elements. Array is
index based , first element of the array is stored at index 0 index.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
1- Array length is fixed but ArrayList length is dynamic .
2-Arrays can contain primitive and non primitive data type but ArrayList contain only non primitive data type(objects);
3- Array element's can be accessed  by using an index [], ArrayList has a set of methods.

what is LinkedList?
LinkedList in Java. Linked List are linear data structures where the elements are not stored in contiguous locations and
 every element is a separate object
 with a data part and address part. The elements are linked using pointers and addresses.

How is an Array different from Linked List?
1-88888888

what is queue?
Queue represents a data structure designed to have elements inserted at the end of the queue,
and elements removed from the beginning of the queue.

what is stack?

what is FIFO and LIFO?
FIFO: Stands for "First In First Out" is a method in which items are processed  in the order they have been entered.
Certain data structures like Queue and other variants of Queue uses FIFO approach for processing data.

LIFO: Stands for "Last In First Out"  is a method for handling data structures where the first element is processed last
 and the last element is processed first. In Stack elements can be accessed on the basis of LIFO.

what is the order of complexity?

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
Binary search & sorting algorithm.

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
what is tree in data structure?
what is graph in data structure?
what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
RDBMS----->Arrays.
Network data model----->Graph;
Hierarchical data model-----> Tree.

How HashMap works in java?
HashMap implements  MAP interface it  works on the principle of Hashing. It stores elements as key-value pairs.
Java has a hash function which called hashCode(). The hashCode() method is implemented in the Object class and therefore
each class in Java inherits it.The hash code provides the hash value.

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is an Exception that we need to handle. it is thrown to indicate that we are trying to
access array element with an illegal index.
This exception is thrown when the index is either negative or greater than or equal to the size of the array.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
What is difference between an array and a linked list?
What is DFS and BFS?
What is Recursion?
What are linear and non linear data Structures?
What is Big-(O)-notation?
Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
